ORF 360: Decision Modeling in Business Analytics - Airfare Network Modeling
The file ORF360_Airfare_Network.R uses the file 'csv/product_incidence' as input. 
This file is a table that contains the product-incidence matrix, 
followed by a price vector in the next line, 
followed by a request rate vector in the final line. Feel free to inspect the file 
'csv/product_incidence' to understand the formatting.

Executing the R script given the proper input will print the initial value of the value function.
This is the maximum value in the output file matrix.

The images folder contains plots generated in MATLAB that show the relationship
between certain parameters and the initial value function.

Also included in this repo is the report that illustrates the mathematical model, and other findings.
